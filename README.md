# DataStructures_AnagramHashMap
Computes the group(s) of English words with the most anagrams using a prime-factor hash. Each word maps to a Long via the product of letter primes; anagrams share the same key. Builds a hash table from `words_alpha.txt`, then reports the key, the list of words with the maximum anagram count, and timing.
